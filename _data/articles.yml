  body: "<h2>Intro</h2><p>Tinker Knob, often mistakenly called Tinker’s Knob, is the
    highest point along the Pacific Crest between Squaw Valley and Donner Summit.
    &nbsp;The knob itself, a small peak along the ridgeline, also serves as an approximate
    halfway marker between the two access points. A run from Donner Summit to Squaw
    passes more than just Tinker Knob though –it’s also a tour through some of the
    finest landscapes the Northern Sierra has to offer: windswept ridgelines running
    along the blue sky, green and purple lupines poking up through the rock, and Clark’s
    nutcrackers cackling from the top of ancient, twisted pine trees.</p><h2>What
    Makes It Great</h2><p>For most of its length the run follows the Pacific Crest
    Trail. &nbsp;The Pacific Crest Trail, which winds for almost 2,700 miles between
    Mexico and Canada, adheres strictly to the true Pacific Crest along this run –squeeze
    your water bottle on one side of the trail and it will drain to the Pacific Ocean.
    Squirt it but a few feet further on the other side of the trail and the water
    bottle’s contents will empty into the Great Basin. &nbsp;It’s pure ridgeline running
    –which makes for spectacular, 360 degree views as well.</p><p>This run is usually
    started from the north where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses Old Highway 40 near
    Sugar Bowl Ski Area. &nbsp;The trail climbs up and away from the highway and beyond
    Roller Pass, the famous location where early pioneers rolled their wagons over
    the crux of their Sierra crossing. &nbsp;From there, the trail follows the undulating
    windswept ridge all the way past Tinker Knob. &nbsp;Just south of Tinker Knob,
    the trail drops off the crest, crosses a few small creeks, and then climbs again
    through the trees before its junction with the Granite Chief Trail. &nbsp;The
    Granite Chief Trail plummets down through Shirley Canyon’s spectacular Granite
    walls before reaching the floor of Squaw Valley. &nbsp;This run can be done as
    an out-and-back to Tinker Knob, or as a through run from Old Highway 40 to Squaw
    Valley.</p><h2>Who is Going to Love It</h2><p>Those looking for a long, high Alpine
    run without large elevation changes will love this route. &nbsp;From Old Highway
    40 to the base of Tinker Knob the trail rises 1,600’feet in elevation in just
    under 8 miles –and most of that takes place in the initial climb away from Donner
    Summit. &nbsp;For those wishing to continue their run past Tinker Knob the trail
    starts to rise and fall a bit more, especially at the end where the Granite Chief
    Trail drops over 1,900 feet in just 3.2 miles. &nbsp;The final descent can be
    a bit hard on the knees after a long day. From Tinker Knob to Squaw Valley via
    the Granite Chief Trail is an additional 6.1 miles.</p><h2>Directions, Parking,
    & Regulations</h2><p>From Truckee, drive up Old Highway 40/Donner Pass Road for
    approximately 9.3 miles. &nbsp;Turn left on Old Donner Summit Road. &nbsp;Parking
    is free along Old Donner Summit Road. &nbsp;Follow the signs for the Pacific Crest
    Trail.</p>"

  body: <h2>Intro</h2><p>The Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT) is a 168 mile path that circles
    the iconic lake. Only a select few portions are open to mountain bikers. Some
    of the best are found on the northeastern circuit that connects via Tahoe Meadows
    and the Flume Trail to the TRT. Incredible views, spicy riding, and memorable
    adventures await on this classic ride. &nbsp;</p><h2>What Makes It Great</h2><p>The
    TRT is best done as a shuttle ($15) from the Tunnel Creek Cafe and please note,
    the TRT is only open to bikes on even numbered days. The sheer grandiose nature
    of this ride is worth the extra fuss to set up logistics. Views of Lake Tahoe
    are simply gorgeous, with each new viewpoint more spectacular than the previous.
    The riding is a lot of fun as well, with a combination of singletrack, packed
    sand, boulders, and enough technical terrain to keep your wandering eyes focused
    on the trail. There are some stiff climbs (hey, you have to earn those views somehow)
    and navigation for first timers can take a little work, but the overall experience
    of this trail is fantastic. The TRT eventually merges to the steep, speedy, singletrack
    of the Flume Trail, where sandy, forested, switchbacks drop back down to lower
    elevations.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Going to Love It</h2><p>If you're not in shape,
    you'll be exposed pretty early in the ride. A 900 foot vertical gain out of Tahoe
    Meadows isn't technical but can sizzle the quads of the uninitiated. &nbsp;The
    terrain itself is geared towards intermediates with good lungs, so beginners might
    be challenged along the way. Experts enjoy the variety of skills employed to master
    the trail, stiff climbs and, of course, the zippy descents.&nbsp;</p><h2>Directions,
    Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>The shuttles from <a href="http://tunnelcreekcafe.com/"
    target="_blank">Tunnel Creek Cafe</a>, 1115 Tunnel Creek Rd.Incline Village, NV
    89451, are the way to go. They are $15 per person and you will finish your ride
    at the Tunnel Creek Cafe.&nbsp;</p><p>For more details and maps on this excellent

  body: <h2>Intro</h2><p>The 63,000 acre Desolation Wilderness situated just West
    of Lake Tahoe is a hiker’s paradise. The majority of Desolation’s roughly 80 named
    lakes are within a day hike from any trailhead, with ample vistas of sharp granite
    peaks, lush meadows, and old growth forest in abundance. Both the 2,650 mile Pacific
    Crest Trail and the 165 mile Tahoe Rim Trail share an approximately 22 mile segment
    of absolutely stunning trail through this breathtaking corner of Lake Tahoe. While
    I certainly can’t speak for the entire PCT, this segment of the Tahoe Rim Trail
    is hands down the most scenic portion of an already stunning through hike.</p><h2>What
    Makes It Great</h2><p>Beginning from the Echo Lakes trailhead and hiking North,
    the PCT/TRT skirts the Northern shoreline of Lower and Upper Echo lakes before
    crossing the Desolation Wilderness boundary. A corridor of trail junctions continues
    for several miles, with no less than nine lakes lying less than a mile away from
    the PCT/TRT from the trailhead to Lake Aloha.As the largest lake in Desolation
    Wilderness, Lake Aloha lies 6.0 miles from the Echo Lakes trailhead (if you don’t
    take the water shuttle). This 12 mile roundtrip journey is a formidable option
    for a dayhike, especially if you leave room for exploration of the many side lakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing
    past Lake Aloha, the PCT/TRT starts to gain a high alpine feel as you hike past
    stunted wind-blown trees through huge slabs of glacially sculpted granite. Dick’s
    Pass (13.6 miles from Echo Lakes trailhead) acts as a mid-way divider of Desolation
    Wilderness as the trail morphs from the high country feel into low-lying lush
    valleys and wildflowers. This northern portion of trail bids farewell to abundant
    lakes and welcomes a dense, old-growth forest with streams meandering throughout.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple
    trips can be made to connect with the PCT/TRT as it winds through Desolation.
    Recommended trailheads include Echo Lakes for South to North, Glen Alpine (Fallen
    Leaf Lake)and &nbsp;Bayview/Eagle Falls for exploring the heart of Desolation,
    and Meeks Bay for a North to South traverse.</p><h2>Who is Going to Love It</h2><p>Intermediate
    and expert hikers alike will thoroughly enjoy everything the Desolation Wilderness
    section of the Tahoe Rim Trail and Pacific Crest Trail has to offer. This roughly
    22-mile segment is best accomplished in a series of out and back hikes or point
    to point hikes with car shuttles.</p><h2>Directions, Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>Day
    use permits are required for all travel in Desolation Wilderness. These help land
    managers assess trailhead use and help emergency responders locate people in case
    of backcountry emergencies. Free day use permits can be obtained at all trailheads
    that access Desolation Wilderness. For more information on rules and regulations
    in Desolation Wilderness, visit the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/ltbmu/recreation/?cid=stelprdb5157638"
    target="_blank">Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit</a>.</p><p>From South Lake Tahoe,
    drive west on Highway 50 toward Sacramento. As you drive over Echo Summit, a short
    passing lane emerges with the single lane Johnson Pass Road branching off to the
    right. Bear right on Johnson Pass Road, then take your second right following
    signs for Echo Lakes. Parking can be challenging during busy summer months.</p>

  body: "<h2>Intro</h2><p>This challenging ride offers steep climbs and unparalleled
    views of Lake Tahoe. There are two prominent hills on this route—800 feet up to
    an Emerald Bay overlook and a 1,000 foot gain at Spooner Junction. Several rolling
    hills throughout the ride bring the total elevation gain up to 4,024 vertical
    feet. This 72-mile ride is not for beginners; budget at least 5 hours to make
    your way around the lake. Start your ride early in the morning to avoid the heavy
    traffic from commuters and tourists alike.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Makes It Great</h2><p>You
    can begin your journey from any point around the lake, but starting counterclockwise
    from South Lake Tahoe is a popular way to tackle this challenge. Put the lake
    on your right hand side and head west along Highway 50. At the junction of Highway
    50 and 89 in the small town of Meyers, continue right towards Emerald Bay on 89.
    There is a bike trail that runs parallel to the road, but unfortunately it only
    lasts for about 3 miles. There is a steep downhill followed by a rigorous uphill
    climb at the stunning Emerald Bay. Your next vista point is the equally beautiful
    D.L. Bliss State Park.&nbsp;</p><p>From the west side of the lake continue on
    through the more residential north Tahoe towns. Take Highway 28 from Tahoe City
    to Sand Harbor State Park after crossing into Nevada. This is a popular campground
    area where you can stop for water during busier months. It is also the sight of
    the most rigorous climb along the ride. A steady nine miles of uphill will take
    you to the top of Spooner summit.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, there are a few rolling
    hills and stunning vistas, but you will descend back to lake level as you head
    back onto the South Lake stretch after connecting once more with Highway 50.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who
    is Going to Love It</h2><p>This is a must do for well-conditioned cyclists looking
    to get a longer ride at a high elevation. Cyclist will start the route at 6,300
    feet above sea level and top out at 7,100, making this a feat not for the faint
    of heart or &nbsp;those who are out of shape.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, this
    is an epic ride thanks to the clean mountain air and the unmatched views of the
    entire lake. Don’t forget to soak in the scenery as you are huffing and puffing
    up those hills.&nbsp;</p><h2>Directions, Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>Start you
    ride to the west of the hustle and bustle of Heavenly and other South Lake Tahoe
    shops and casinos. El Dorado beach right of Highway 50 and next to the water is
    a great place to leave your car for the duration of your ride. Other residential
    areas and beach access parks all along the lake usually have parking lots if you
    choose to start in another location.</p>"

  body: "<h2>Intro</h2><p>One of the best places for road running in North Tahoe isn’t
    a road at all –it’s the Truckee River Trail. &nbsp;The Truckee River Trail is
    an 8 mile paved multipurpose path nestled between Highway 89 and the Truckee River.</p><p>In
    Tahoe City, the Truckee River exits Lake Tahoe and flows north toward Truckee.
    &nbsp;For eight miles the Truckee River Trail parallels the river’s ebbs and flows.
    &nbsp;Towering rock, tall pines, lush vegetation, and the rush of the river itself
    make this popular trail a memorable spot for a paved run.</p><h2>What Makes It
    Great</h2><p>While the Truckee River Trail runs along busy Highway 89, the trail
    itself, like the river, sits below the surface of the highway. &nbsp;The slight
    differences in elevation create a radically different feel and experience than
    running along a busy street –vehicles are heard, but not seen or felt. &nbsp;What
    is seen and felt is the intimate beauty of the river corridor.</p><p>The Truckee
    River Trail begins on the west end of Tahoe City, and ends at the mouth of Squaw
    Valley. &nbsp;For the most part flat, the trail matches the grade of the river.
    &nbsp;An out and back from Tahoe City would thus have a slight incline on the
    return as one runs upstream. &nbsp;The run is at its best during a summer morning
    or evening when cooler temperatures prevail, opportunities for solitude abound,
    and the slanted sunlight makes the aspen, cottonwood, willow, and gooseberry leaves
    lining the water glow green.</p><p>The trail is very popular in the middle of
    the summer, which coincides with the best time to float and swim in the river.
    &nbsp;This is a multipurpose trail, so watch for cyclists, strollers, skateboarders,
    and sunscreen slathered swimmers looking for the best place to launch their inner
    tubes.</p><h2>Who is Going to Love It</h2><p>Those looking for an alternative
    to the small-shouldered Tahoe Area road system will love this run. &nbsp;Beginner
    runners will as well, due to the easy grade and shade along the path. &nbsp;The
    run can be done as a 16-mile out-and back, or as an 8-mile shuttle.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature
    lovers of all ability should love this run too. &nbsp;Watch for mergansers riding
    the riffles and king fishers darting above the pool. &nbsp;Wildflowers dot the
    trail from June through mid-July including purple lupine and red columbine. &nbsp;And
    for the history buffs out there: portions of the Truckee River Trail follow the
    same line as the original narrow gauge railroad that brought early tourists to
    Lake Tahoe.</p><h2>Directions, Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>Parking is free in
    Tahoe City, but space is limited, especially in summer. &nbsp;A better option
    is to park at 64 Acre Park a quarter mile south of Tahoe City on Highway 89. &nbsp;64
    Acre park has a large parking lot for visitors and parking is free. A bike path
    winds through the 64 Acre Park and crosses the Truckee River on a small bridge
    to meet up with the Truckee River Trail.</p>"

      hours before work or lapped throughout the day. '
  body: <h2>Intro</h2><p>Waterhouse and Powderhouse peaks are icons in the Tahoe backcountry
    scene for the ease of access, steep gladed descents, and relative avalanche safety.
    Whether accomplished as a dawn patrol outing before your desk job or lapped on
    endless powder days, these two peaks offer challenging terrain for all backcountry
    skiers and riders. Waterhouse Peak offers more vertical feet with more mellow
    terrain, while Powderhouse peak offers steep gullies, open trees, and short cliff
    sections. Familiarity with the terrain is a must on Powderhouse to avoid any potential
    mandatory air situations. Finally, although a safer bet when avalanche conditions
    rise, Waterhouse and Powderhouse should never be considered 100% avalanche safe.</p><h2>What
    Makes It Great</h2><p>Perched at the top of Luther Pass, a short drive south of
    Meyers, CA, the Waterhouse/Powderhouse ridgleline runs a near perfect east-west
    line, meaning the old-growth fir, whitebark pine, and hemlock glades blanketing
    the mountain hold legendary north-facing cold powder for days after a storm. The
    7,700’ base of the approach also means that Waterhouse/Powderhouse is a sure bet
    for snow when it’s raining in town.</p><p>When driving from South Lake Tahoe,
    the pullout for Powderhouse Peak appears immediately on your right as the Highway
    89 tops out on Luther Pass. From the pull out, the skin track can’t be missed
    as it aims directly up the mountain for a 1,650’ climb. Once upon the summit,
    multiple descent options exist. Traversing to skier’s right will lead to Powderhouse’s
    steep, rocky bowl, which is to be avoided during avalanche conditions. Skiing
    fall-line straight back to the car is always a good option, that provides steeper
    sections of tree runs and a few natural gullies. Traversing skier’s left can sometimes
    offer a bit more untouched powder, but also requires a flat traverse back to the
    car.</p><p>Parking for Waterhouse Peak can be found in a pullout on the right,
    just as Highway 89 descends down to Hope Valley. Follow the skin track up the
    looker’s left shoulder of the mountain as it mostly follows the ridgeline to the
    summit. The descent from Waterhouse is pretty simple, with all north-facing routes
    leading back to the huge meadow at the base of the mountain. Enjoy wide open old-growth
    trees and untouched cold powder the entire way down.</p><h2>Who is Going to Love
    It</h2><p>Waterhouse and Powderhouse Peak offer a little something for skiers
    and riders of all backcountry ability levels (skiers and riders must still be
    proficient). Typically low avalanche concerns mean that these peaks are often
    a safer bet than other terrain in Tahoe. Due to its low avalanche danger and ease
    of access, these two peaks can see heavy use. There are still plenty of fresh
    tracks to be had as long as everyone respects each other and the mountain. In
    short, be properly trained for avalanche scenarios and practice proper backcountry
    etiquette, especially with regard to the skin track.</p><h2>Directions, Parking,
    & Regulations</h2><p>From South Lake Tahoe, take Highway 50 west as if driving
    to Sacramento. In Meyers, CA turn left on Highway 89 south toward Markleeville.
    Continue on Highway 89 for approximately 7 miles. Parking will be available in
    turnouts on the righthand side of the highway. Please respect all no parking signs
    and all snow removal operations.</p><p>Refer to current avalanche conditions by

  body: <h2>Intro</h2><p>The 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail is arguably one of the most
    scenic through hikes in the country.. From volcanic rock formations and glacially
    carved valleys, to lush meadows packed with wildflowers and dense forests of hemlock,
    the sheer number of micro-climates on the Tahoe Rim Trail will keep this trek
    interesting for everyone.</p><h2>What Makes It Great</h2><p><strong>Echo Lakes
    to Barker Pass - 32.7 miles</strong></p><p>Shared by the Pacific Crest Trail,
    this section offers abundant alpine lakes and a breathtaking trek through Desolation
    Wilderness. Echo Lakes to Barker Pass acts as a perfect introduction to the TRT
    with low risk and maximum reward.</p><p><strong>Barker Pass to Tahoe City - 16.7
    miles</strong></p><p>The TRT meanders through the volcanic outcropping of Twin
    Peaks before descending through lush fields of mule’s ear and blooming wildflowers.
    Camping options are limited if you push all the way to Tahoe City, but the pizza
    and beer from Front Street is well worth the trek into town.</p><p><strong>Tahoe
    City to Brockway Summit - 20.2 miles</strong></p><p>The trail maintains a persistent
    climb from Tahoe City to Watson Lake, a car-accessible campground that might offer
    the fortune of car camping food shared by good Samaritan neighbors (at least that
    was this author’s experience).</p><p><strong>Brockway Summit to Tahoe Meadows
    - 20.2 miles</strong></p><p>Gaining elevation to join the high-altitude Mt. Rose
    Wilderness, you are greeted by vast fields of blooming mule’s ear that appear
    to drop all the way to the shores of Lake Tahoe. The climbing continues as you
    huff and puff to the highest point of the TRT at the 10, 338’ summit of Relay
    Peak before descending down to Tahoe Meadows.</p><p><strong>Tahoe Meadows to Spooner
    Summit - 23.1 miles</strong></p><p>Turning southbound on the east shore of Lake
    Tahoe, the TRT sets its sights on wide-open ridgelines and ducks in and out of
    massive Western White Pines. A Hilton-esque backcountry experience awaits at the
    Marlette Peak backcountry camp, complete with pit toilet, water pump, campfire
    rings, and picnic tables.</p><p><strong>Spooner Summit to Kingsbury - 18.5 miles</strong></p><p>This
    is one of the driest stretches of the TRT, with seasonal streams typically dry
    by mid-summer. The parched nature of the trail is only a minor setback when considering
    the stunning vistas of both Lake Tahoe and the vast Carson Valley visible from
    the ridge.</p><p><strong>Kingsbury to Big Meadow - 23.2 miles</strong></p><p>This
    is one of the more strenuous portions of the TRT as you climb over Monument Pass,
    Free Saddle, and Armstrong Pass. Regardless, overnight camping at Star Lake combined
    with in-your-face views of Tahoe’s highest summit, Freel Peak, make this one of
    the most scenic sections as well.</p><p><strong>Big Meadow to Echo Lakes - 17.5
    miles</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most scenically diverse section of trail, the
    TRT passes through verdant Meiss Meadow, volcanic Showers Lake, and jagged granite
    bowls before finally completing the full circle journey back at Echo Lakes.</p><h2>Who
    is Going to Love It</h2><p>The TRT offers day hikes, section hikes, and through
    hikes for backpackers of all abilities. As a through-hike, this is a perfect medium
    distance trail for those who have never gone on extended backpacking trips.</p><h2>Directions,
    Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>The non-profit <a href="http://www.tahoerimtrail.org/"
    target="_blank">Tahoe Rim Trail Association</a> is the ultimate resource for maps,
    driving directions, trail conditions, and information on the Tahoe Rim Trail.</p><p>A
    campfire permit and Desolation Wilderness permit are required for the through-hike
    and can be obtained from the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit headquarters in
    South Lake Tahoe.</p>

    <p>Lake Tahoe has long been beloved among Bay Area adventure seekers as a year-round mecca for outdoor pursuits, with its 300 days of sunshine and gorgeous alpine landscape prime for hiking, mountain biking, road riding, and paddling, not to mention 400 inches of snowfall that makes for some of California’s most coveted skiing and snowboarding.</p>

    <p>And, as locals well know, spring is an especially sublime time of year in Lake Tahoe, with sunny days and fewer crowds as the ski season winds to a close. If you need another reason for a visit, consider the&nbsp;burgeoning craft beer scene—<a href="http://www.alibialeworks.com/" target="_blank">Alibi Ale Works</a>, a&nbsp;cool&nbsp;craft brewery that opened in late 2014 in Incline Village, is the latest celebrated addition—that makes a perfect complement to a day spent getting after it in the great outdoors.</p>

    <p>Which is&nbsp;where the <a href="http://bit.ly/TahoeAleTrail" target="_blank">North Lake Tahoe Ale Trail</a>&nbsp;comes in, by helping both visitors and locals alike to check out a new (or new to them) adventure-centric experience, followed up with a well-earned adult beverage at a local watering hole. With a nifty interactive map of paddling, hiking, and biking routes and&nbsp;pop-up windows of videos, trail beta, and recommendations for bars and restaurants, the ale trail offers a handy way to explore adventure-and-adult-beverage pairings in Tahoe for both locals and visitors.</p>

    <p>&quot;With craft breweries continuously exploding in North Lake Tahoe, we had thought about creating a brewery map, but, the more and more we looked at it, the more we realized that wouldn&#39;t work,&quot; says Andy Chapman, CEO of Incline Village Crystal Bay Visitors Bureau and an avid road&nbsp;biker. &quot;The vibe that makes North Lake Tahoe so authentically alpine is the fact that outdoor activities are ingrained into every aspect of the culture. Locals and visitors alike spend the majority of a day outside exploring, and frequently end the activity with a great beverage. The Ale Trail simply expanded upon a pattern that has always existed in the area.&quot;</p>

    <p>Here, a few recommended ways to enjoy the North Lake Tahoe Ale Trail, yet another reason to raise a glass to Tahoe and make an autumn getaway to NorCal&#39;s favorite alpine lake&nbsp;before the flakes&nbsp;start falling.</p>

    <p>The dazzling aquamarine waters of Lake Tahoe are best enjoyed up close, which means grabbing your paddle and hopping in a canoe or kayak. The East Shore is a prime spot, with&nbsp;boulders dotting the surface and intricate passageways that are a blast to navigate through.</p>

    <p>As of late, Tahoe has kicked up its reputation as an SUP hotspot, too, with races throughout the summer and fall. Say farewell to the SUP season with the <a href="http://tahoecup.org/" target="_blank">Tahoe Fall Classic</a>, scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 26. The event, now in its third year, is a 22-mile point-to-point race from Camp Richardson in South Lake Tahoe to Kings Beach on the North Shore.</p>

    <p>Whether you come for this&nbsp;hard-charging race or a lazy paddle, you’ll want to cap off your water-based adventure with a toast at one of Tahoe’s buzziest bars, Pier 111 at the <a href="http://laketahoe.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html" target="_blank">Hyatt Regency</a>, which offers a California-cool take on the floating bar concept. (Hotel guests can launch their SUP right from the hotel property, while other paddlers can put in at the Hidden Beach area, just east of Incline Village.)</p>

    <p>Lake Tahoe offers a head-spinning array of hikes in the Incline Village, Kings Beach, and Crystal Bay areas, from easy lakeside strolls to lung-busting treks with views that will take your breath away (if the effort doesn’t). Serious hikers head to Mt. Rose, the 10,377-foot peak that’s the highest in the region. It’s a 12-mile round-trip route to make it to the top, including a final two-mile scramble over slick switchbacks, with splendid views of the alpine lake, Reno, and the surrounding 30,000-acre Mt. Rose Wilderness. Once you’ve made it back down, you’ve certainly earned your beers at <a href="http://www.mellowfellowpub.com/kingsbeach.php" target="_blank">Mellow Fellow</a> , a groovy gastropub whose name belies its low-key vibe.</p>

Afterward, ease the saddle soreness by soaking up some of the beers on tap at <a href="http://tahoebrewing.com/" target="_blank">Tahoe Mountain Brewing</a> .

  body: "<h2>Intro</h2><p>High above the east shore of Lake Tahoe sits Tahoe Meadows,
    a popular winter destination for cross-country skiers, snowshoe wanderers, and
    view seekers. Nestled at the base of Mount Rose and Tamarack Peak to the north,
    and Slide Mountain to the east, Tahoe Meadows is a flat expanse of quality snow
    stretching south from the Mount Rose Highway and associated parking area. Skiing
    through the meadows offers views of the surrounding peaks and gnarled, ancient,
    high-alpine pines. For those wanting a peek at Lake Tahoe, climb along the gentle,
    rolling ridgeline to the west of the meadow to access dozens of dazzling lake
    panorama locations.</p><h2>What Makes It Great</h2><p>Aside from the plethora
    of lake views, Tahoe Meadows offers something other snowplay or cross country
    ski locations cannot: lots of snow. Between 8,500’ and 8,700’ Tahoe Meadows sits
    high enough to keep its snow through the winter and even into mid-spring depending
    on the snowfall. And while snow conditions here can change dramatically with the
    large temperature shifts found along most west coast mountain ranges, good snow
    is usually found high –and Tahoe Meadows rises 1,200’-1,500’ above nearby Echo,
    Donner, and Brockway Summits. Be on the lookout for cold, freezing temperatures
    at night followed by warm days under the sun. This can fill Tahoe Meadows with
    “corn snow” a spring condition characterized by soft, grainy snow perfect for
    the slide and glide of cross country skiing.</p><p>Tahoe Meadows, and the ridgeline
    to the west, are also large enough to accommodate even the most robust Tahoe weekend
    crowd. Don’t like groups crowding in on your lake view? Simply slide over to the
    next knob for regained solitude. The wide open spaces and scattering of pines
    makes it easy to plot your course away from the crowds and equally easy to find
    your way back at the end of your adventure. &nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Going to Love
    It</h2><p>Beginner cross country skiers will love the flat meadow, perfect for
    the first time away from the groomed trails of your local cross country center.
    Intermediate cross country skiers will love the rolling terrain west of the meadows
    where they can test their ability to climb and descend. For the bird lovers, Tahoe
    Meadows carries a secret as well: &nbsp;flocks of tiny chickadees gather and will
    often alight on ski poles and open palms looking for a free handout.&nbsp;</p><h2>Directions,
    Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>From Incline Village, NV go up the Mount Rose Highway
    (Route 431) for approximately seven miles. &nbsp;It’s free and legal to park along
    the Mount Rose Highway. &nbsp;Note that you will be sharing the parking spots
    with other winter users: Snowmobilers, backcountry skiers, and snowshoe hikers.
    &nbsp;The snowmobiles head north of the highway, as do most of the backcountry
    skiers. &nbsp;There are no facilities at this trailhead so be sure to pack out
    all your trash and dog waste. &nbsp;And even though they’re cute, please do not
    feed the Chickadees as with all wild animals.</p>"

  body: "<h2>Intro</h2><p>Infrequent visitors, a multitude of faces to climb, and
    a gorgeous approach along the Pacific Rim Trail all make climbing at Echo Lake
    well worth stepping off the beaten path. There are a couple hundred routes to
    choose from on over 10 faces of rock on Lower Echo, which is the lake you see
    from the parking area. It is connected by a small channel to Upper Echo, which
    located to the Northwest of where you will leave your car.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Makes
    It Great</h2><p>While you will see many visitors to the area there to hike the
    PCT or stay in some of the rustic cabins dotted along the lake, you won’t see
    many climbers in the area. Routes vary from 30 to 300 feet and from 5.7s to 5.12d.
    The approach is on the longer side but relatively easy along the well maintained
    PCT. Cutting up to your chosen route from the trail can involve a little bit of
    strategic bushwhacking and rigorous effort, however.&nbsp;</p><p>The scenery,
    in addition to the quality climbing routes, makes it all worth the effort. The
    landscape features windswept and sunbleached trees, bright granite boulders, and
    the deep blue waters of the 2 Echo Lakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Highlights include the face
    of Flagpole Peak, which is the prominent point along the north side of the lake.
    Bring a flag or old t-shirt to post on the flagpole when you reach the top to
    leave your mark. Other areas to check out include the 5.12 Wall, Billy Land or
    Gansta Wall, and Old Peculiar. The area is mostly trad climbing with a few mixed
    and sport thrown in the mix. There are also plenty of areas to boulder.</p><h2>Who
    is Going to Love It</h2><p>Advanced and frequent climbers who don’t mind a long
    approach are going to love this area because it’s remote and not a lot of people
    know about these routes. While there are some easier routes that beginners or
    middle of the road folks will enjoy, the longer hike and full sun during warmer
    months might wear on the faint of heart.&nbsp;</p><h2>Directions, Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>Parking
    at the Echo Lake Chalet is free, but you will need to fill out a self serve day
    permit at the PCT trailhead, which is located just past the chalet and across
    the small dam and outlet of Upper Echo Lake. Parking is often hard to come by
    at the peak of the season, so getting there early or coming in the off season
    is highly recommended.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no camping allowed along the PCT here
    unless you continue all the way into Desolation Wilderness, which requires an
    overnight permit.&nbsp;</p><p>Echo Lakes Road is located on the north side of
    Highway 50 about 2 miles from the summit on the west side of the mountain range.
    Follow it all the way to the lake, but you might need to park up the hill a bit
    because most of the spots closer to shore are reserved for handicap and loading.&nbsp;</p>"

  body: "<h2>Intro</h2><p>360° views of this crystal clear alpine lake are one of
    a kind and definitely worth the drive out from the better known lakes in closer
    to Tahoe and Truckee. Gold Lake is surrounded by a conifer forest and the granite
    hillsides that are the Sierra Nevada’s claim to fame. &nbsp;</p><h2>What Makes
    It Great</h2><p>The most popular body of water in the Lakes Basin area, Gold Lake
    is a favorite for stand up paddleboarders and kayakers. It is nestled in the Sierra
    Nevada at just above 6,000 feet, which is the perfect elevation in this area to
    soak up some summer warmth and still escape the intense heat of the central valley.&nbsp;</p><p>Located
    in the Plumas National Forest, this lake is often glassy and smooth and offers
    panoramic views of forested hills. It is also well known for its numerous small
    coves and beaches that make for fun exploring for paddlers of all skill levels.&nbsp;</p><p>The
    water is calmest in the morning and evening, so the best time to get in a quick
    paddle is dawn or dusk. If you are a paddler more interested in a fun aquatic
    experience rather than a workout, then the middle of the day is still a great
    time to get out and splash around in the sun.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Going to Love
    It</h2><p>Beginner and recreational paddlers will love this lake, but it is definitely
    worth the visit for more the &nbsp;advanced as well. Power boats are allowed on
    this lake, but they are usually easy enough to avoid in one of the many coves.
    The lake and surrounding campsites can get crowded during peak season, so if that
    is a deterrent try to visit on a weekday.&nbsp;</p><h2>Directions, Parking, &
    Regulations</h2><p>Head east on Highway 49 towards Bassetts. Turn left onto Gold
    Lake Highway and follow this road for about 7 miles. Turn left on Gold Lake Road
    and look for the Gold Lake Campground, which offers free day use and camping for
    $10 a night. There is no potable water so be sure to bring enough with you for
    the duration of your stay.&nbsp;</p>"

    a fresh snow is a great way to experience the beauty of winter in the high Sierra.
    The park has several trails to choose from and a visitors center that is staffed
    through the winter, making it a great place to have a casual snowy hike in the
    middle of Tahoe’s coldest months.</p><h2>What Makes It Great</h2><p>Winter enthusiasts
    will rejoice as they trek through pine trees with snowy boughs and over bridges
    that cross quaint creeks and streams in Galena Creek Park. There are several trails
    to choose from to suit your fancy when it comes to a snowy hike. Start on the
    mellow and short Bitterbrush Trail (.5 mile) or the casual Nature Trail (1 mile).
    Both are clearly marked and well trafficked through the winter time, making them
    ideal for those new to snowshoeing and winter hikes.&nbsp;</p><p>The more experienced
    snowshoer might want to embark on the Jones-Whites Loop Trail, which requires
    you to climb about 1,893 feet over the course of a 9 mile loop. If you are up
    for the challenge you will be rewarded with a stunning winter vista at the highest
    point of the loop at about 8,000 feet.</p><h2>Who is Going to Love It</h2><p>Since
    there is a route for anyone willing to strap on a pair of snowshoes, this area
    is a favorite for beginners and experts alike. It is a great area for families
    to venture out into the snow together.</p><h2>Directions, Parking, & Regulations</h2><p>Head
    west on State Route 431/Mt. Rose Highway towards Lake Tahoe after exiting Highway
    395. Continue for about 7 miles past this junction to the park’s entrance on the
    west side of the highway.&nbsp;</p>"
